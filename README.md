This is a quick-and-dirty command line tool that converts plain old PCM WAV
files to LP2 ATRAC3 files using Sony's Windows codec (atrac3.acm) and the
Windows ACM API.

Compiles with Visual Studio 2015. Works on Windows and WINE.
Presumably 32-bit only since I doubt there's a publicly-available x86_64
build of the codec.
